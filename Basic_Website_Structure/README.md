The journey begins just like the inception of the internet with the understanding of basic HTML.

# 🔤 HTML Syntax & Semantic Tags Tutorial

Welcome to my **single-page HTML tutorial and reference guide** — a hands-on, commented walkthrough of key HTML tags, layout elements, semantic structure, form fields, and embedded media. This project is designed to reinforce the fundamentals while serving as a living tutorial for others.

## 📌 About This Project

I built this page as both:
- A **personal learning resource**
- And a **portfolio-ready demo** to showcase my ability to structure, document, and explain HTML clearly

It includes:
- Headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images
- Semantic tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`
- Interactive form examples and `<table>` elements
- Embedded video, iframe, and multimedia elements
- Commented code throughout for learning and reference

This project reflects not just what I know, but how I **teach**, **organize**, and **think like a dev**.
